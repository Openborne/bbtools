undcx - Decompress DCX files

undcx is a tool for decompressing DCX/DEFLATE files. You will
need zlib to compile this tool.

To compile and install, simply type in:

make
make install

You can use undcx like so:

undcx <infile>

and it should print the decompressed data to stdout. It is preferable to
redirect the output into a separate file.
