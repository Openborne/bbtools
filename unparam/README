unparam - Extract param field info

This utility will extract param field info by reading in the appropriate
fields from the paramdef (parameter definition/header) with the associated
param file.

To compile and install, simply type in:

make
make install

You can use unparam like so:

unparam <paramdef> <param>

and it will print the parameter data to standard output in CSV format.
