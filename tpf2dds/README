tpf2dds - DSIII/Bloodborne TPF to DDS conversion utility

This utility has been converted from C# Bytecode into C++ code, the
convert function at this point is extremely messy.

To compile and install, simply type in:

make
make install

You can use tpf2dds like so:

tpf2dds file.tpf dir

and the program will output DDS files into the directory `dir` from file
`file.tpf`. Make sure you have created the directory beforehand.
